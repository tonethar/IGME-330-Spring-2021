# Project 2 Breakout Groups

## I. Overview
- Over the weekend, in "cross-sectional" teams, you received and gave feedback regarding the [Project 2](project-2.md) prototypes.
- Hopefully you have already incorporated some of that feedback into your prototype, and published those changes to banjo.
- Today we will put you in Zoom breakout groups consisting of 4 or so students, and you will repeat the process with a different group of students, drawn solely from this section.

## II. Instructions

1) If you haven't already posted your prototype changes to banjo, do so immediately

2) Wait to be assigned to a Zoom breakout room

3) Choose one of you to "scribe" - this person will record the names of everyone in your breakout room, and the answers to the questions below. 
These answers will be added to a document (DOC or PDF) and posted to the dropbox. Only ONE document per team will be submitted to the dropbox. *Note, if you wish, the most efficient approach might be to create a Google Doc and collaboratively edit it. Regardless, the scribe will be responsible for doing the final editing and posting of the document to myCourses.*

***PS - For best results, turning on your camera, talking to each other, and sharing your screen to demo your project will likely give the most productive results - Don't just edit the Google DOC in silence :-(***

4) Add the following to the document:

    - the names of each breakout room member, and the link to their working project on banjo
    - as a group, for each project, discuss and summarize your answers to the following questions
    - you are likely only going to have 10 minutes or so per project
    - below are the questions you need to answer as a group, and a template you could follow:

```
Scribe: 

Project #1 Author(s):
Project #1 Link: 
Project #1 "One-liner" description: (ex "A restaurant finder for hungry people") 
Questions to answer as a group:
1) List 3 or 4 features such an app must have to be meet the objective of its "One-liner" and make it "portfolio worthy" (or nearly so)
2) Describe how the current version of the app is making progress towards being portfolio worthy:
i) How well does the app serve its purpose? Is it obvious who the audience is?
ii) Can you figure out how to use it?
iii) Does it have all the controls it needs? Are they sensible/well-labeled?
iv) Is localStorage working properly? Can you reset the experience?
iv) Is the visual design pleasing? (C.R.A.P.)
v) Does it stand out in some way from existing class examples?
vi) Peek at the code. (Use the Sources tab in the Dev Tools). Is it clean and easy to read? Well commented?
vii) Anything else that might help improve the project and make it “portfolio-worthy”?


Project #2 Author(s):
Project #2 Link: 
etc ...
```

## III. Submission
- After class, the scribe should spend a few minutes to clean up the document (edit for clarity/brevity, fix spelling errors, format it so that it's readable etc...)
- The scribe will then post this to the myCourses dropbox before it closes, and will distribute a copy to each member.
