# Project 1 Breakout Groups

## I. Overview
- Over the weekend, in "cross-sectional" teams, you received and gave feedback regarding the Project 1 prototypes.
- Hopefully you have already incorporated some of that feedback into your prototype, and published those changes to banjo.
- Today we will put you in Zoom breakout groups consisting of 4 or so students, and you will repeat the process with a different group of students, drawn solely from this section.

## II. Instructions

1) If you haven't already posted your prototype changes to banjo, do so immediately

2) Wait to be assigned to a Zoom breakout room

3) Choose one of you to "scribe" - this person will record the names of everyone in your breakout room, and the answers to the questions below. 
These answers will be added to a document (DOC or PDF) and posted to the dropbox. Only ONE document per team will be submitted to the dropbox.

4) Add the following to the document:

    - the names of each breakout room member, and the link to their working project on banjo
    - as a group, for each project, discuss and summarize your answers to the following questions
    - you are likely only going to have 10 minutes or so per project
    - below are the questions you need to answer as a group, and a template you could follow:

```
Project Author(s):
Project Link: 
Questions to answer as a group:
i. How compelling/entertaining is it?
ii. Can you figure out how to use/play it?
iii. Does have all the controls it needs?  Are they sensible/well-labeled?
iv. Is the visual design pleasing? (C.R.A.P.)  Is there an embedded font?
v. Does it stand out in some way?
vi. Peek at the code. (Use the Sources tab in the Dev Tools).  Is it clean and easy to read? Well commented?
vii. What area of this project need more attention to make an excellent experience?  Improving CSS and page design? Following Coding standards?  Going far enough beyond examples?
viii. Anything else that might help improve the project?
```

## III. Submission
- After class, the scribe should spend a few minutes to clean up the document (edit for clarity/brevity, fix spelling errors, format it so that it's readable etc...)
- The scribe will then post this to the myCourses dropbox before it closes, and will distribute a copy to each member.
