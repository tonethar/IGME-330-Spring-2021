# Critique Groups, Project 2 Style!

Here we are again, developing a project that can really benefit by user feedback and testing!  We're going to give you 3 (or more) such opportunities again!

This will work pretty much identically to Project 1... Here's the rundown:

You will have several opportunities to solicit, receive, and consider feedback from others about your project as well as contribute to the improvement of the projects of others (required!) by sharing your own observations and suggestions with them.

We will do this through the use of both an online asynchronous crit group (this coming weekend on Slack) and through an online progress presentation (in Zoom breakout rooms next week).

**Each time that you share the current state of your project with others, the more complete your prototype is, the more useful the feedback will be!**

There will be 5 phases to this process: 

### TL;DR:
  1. Submit Prototype to myCourses by Wednesday Night (April 28th, 11:59pm).  You will get some initial feedback Thursday. 
  2. Go back to your Crit-Group on Slack and post your work-in-progress by Saturday night (May 1st, 11:59pm). 
  3. Give feedback to all others by Sunday night (May 2st, 11:59pm) (see pinned post in group)
  4. Be prepared to demo your project via screen-share in class on Tuesday (May 4th)
  5. Keep using the Crit Groups.

## 1. Submit your Project prototype by Wednesday evening (April 28th, 11:59pm) before your scheduled Thursday (April 29th) Zoom class meeting.

For this submission, you should at a minimum, have two APIs "working" for your project.  Several controls should be present (although probably not with final styling).  The user should be able to interact with your project and see data displayed.  *The further along you are, the more useful the feedback will be.*

The Instructor will open and look at these submissions live during class on Thursday, providing first-reaction feedback and suggestions.  You may also be asked to provide further explanation about your plans, etc.  (So have your microphone ready!)

## 2. By Saturday (May 1st, 11:59pm), you will be required to post a URL to your work-in-progress to your Slack Crit-Group.

In Slack, you will go back to your previous Crit Group which contains about 5 other students from this course (across all 4 sections).  You are allowed to freely share links to your progress so far in this group and ask for ongoing feedback as you continue to work on things.

Again, *the further along you are, the more useful the feedback will be.*

You may also continue to improve and post updates to your project.  Both instructors and teaching assistants will be able to visit and (time permitting) provide feedback on your work as well.

## 3. By Sunday (May 2, 11:59pm), you must provide a short but thoughtful feedback write-up to each of the other people in your Crit Group. 

Following the suggestions in a pinned post in your Crit Group, you should provide feedback about multiple aspects of the other projects posted to your group.  A sample posting will be included so you can get an idea of the kind of feedback we're expecting. Here's a partial list of what we'll be asking you to comment on for each other project:  
  - How well does the app serve it's purpose?  Is it obvious who the audience is?
  - Can you figure out how to use it?
  - Does have all the controls it needs?  Are they sensible/well-labeled?
  - Is localStorage working properly?  Can you reset the experience?
  - Is the visual design pleasing? (C.R.A.P.)
  - Does it stand out in some way from existing class examples?
  - Peek at the code. (Use the Sources tab in the Dev Tools).  Is it clean and easy to read? Well commented?
  - Anything else that might help improve the project and make it "portfolio-worthy"?

Your participation in this regard is absolutely required and will be checked and applied to your course participation grade. You should use Slack's "Reply to thread" feature on the post that contains the URL to keep your Crit Group organized.

Whether or not you follow the advice and/or implement all of the suggestions you get from this process is totally up to you, but we encourage you to take some of these suggestions to heart so as to bring your project closer to the impactful, portfolio-worthy project that we are recommending you create.  Feel free to open a two-way dialog with the people who've given you critiques asking for clarification and/or more details if necessary.  Keep improving your project and let others know when there's something new to try out!

## 4. On Tuesday, May 4th, during one of your class Zoom calls, you'll be placed into breakout rooms for feedback demos.  

Each person in your group will have about 5 to 10 minutes to screen-share and demonstrate your project so far (hopefully with further updates).  You'll begin by opening your project explaining how it works and demonstrating it.  You may also share a live link to your project in the Chat window so that other students can try it out as well.  After your demonstration ask for further feedback and document what people say.  We will ask you to submit your notes after this call to a myCourses dropbox.

## 5. You can and should continue to participate in your Slack Crit Group as the final deadline draws closer.  

Continuing to communicate with each other about this Project and other concerns, questions, ideas, etc.
