# Week 3B - More about Canvas

## I. Review

1. Let's practice transformations! Grab the start files for [Demo B](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/edit/master/notes/canvas-3.md#demo-B)  - the one we didn't do - from last time

## II. More Canvas

1. [Canvas V - Drawing images & Blending Modes](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-5.md)

2. [HW - Sine Wave](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-sine-wave.md) - Here we are going to explore common periodic functions by building both a static sine wave, and an animated one, and maybe give you some ideas for Project 1. Be sure to follow along!

3. Phyllotaxis - [HW - Algorithmic Botany](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-algorithmic-botany.md)
