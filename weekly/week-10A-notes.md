# Week 10A - Context-free Grammars

## I. Overview
Today we will look at:
- [Text-5 - *Context-free Grammars*](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/text-5.md)
- Also be aware that next time we are moving from *unstructured* plain text, to web services (i.e. *structured* text). There is a review exercise for you in mycourses (an updated version of [HW - GIF Finder](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-gif-finder.md)) that you will need to do before our next class (see the mycourses dropbox)

## II. Homework

- *ill-Favored Coast* - the requirements for which are at the end of Text-5 above - this won't take too long!
