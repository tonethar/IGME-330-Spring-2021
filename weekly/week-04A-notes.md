<!--
- Any questions on [Canvas III - Transformations](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-3.md)?
  - Optional Transforms Review for you to try on your own - [HW-try-it.md](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-try-it.md)  (not HW, it was optional)
  - Something to try for fun, if you want, some starter code for a Krustry the Clown Clock - [Demo - Canvas Clock](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/demo-canvas-clock.md)

- On your own, if you think it will help you on Project 1, take a look at some more canvas resources (but you don't have to yet!):
  - [Canvas V - Drawing images & Blending Modes](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-5.md) (we will be looking at this 4B)
  - [Canvas VI - Sprites & Radio Buttons](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-6.md) (we will be looking at this 5A)
- Question: *Are canvas transforms, gradients and bezier curves required on Project 1?* Nope! (But they are on Project 2!)
- Review some of the [Project 1 - Interactive Sandbox](../projects/project-1.md) prototypes:
  - Time allowing, share your project with your classroom neighbors and get some feedback
