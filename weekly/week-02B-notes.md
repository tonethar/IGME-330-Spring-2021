# Week 2B - Periodic Functions & Algorithmic Botany

## I. Overview
Topics:
- Review the *SG-1* HW
- Look at how to draw Sine waves using canvas
- Get you started on Algorithmic Botany (Phyllotaxis)

## II. Presentation

1. Review SG-1
  
2. [HW - Sine Wave](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-sine-wave.md) - Here we are going to explore common periodic functions by building both a static sine wave, and an animated one, and maybe give you some ideas for Project 1. Be sure to follow along!

3. Phyllotaxis - [HW - Algorithmic Botany](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-algorithmic-botany.md)
