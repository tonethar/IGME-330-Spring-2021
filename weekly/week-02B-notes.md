# Week 2B - Periodic Functions & Algorithmic Botany

## I. Overview
Topics:
- Any questions about "Screen Saver plus Controls" from last time?
  - Reminder: be sure to watch the rest of the lecture videos!
- Review the *Hello Canvas* HW
- Look at how to draw Sine waves using canvas
- Get you started on Algorithmic Botany (Phyllotaxis)

## II. Presentation

1. Review [HW - Hello Canvas](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-hello-canvas.md):
  - some of the HW submissions
  - all of the new drawing context *state properties* that were covered in this HW
  - the *drawing state stack* and `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()`
  - loading custom fonts and using them in canvas:
    - in the HW we used an "invisible &lt;div>"
    - another way to load custom fonts is the use the [webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) project - here is a post - [Stack Overflow - Load Custom Font](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46218500/pixijs-load-custom-font/47299469#47299469) - that explains how to do this for both PixiJS and canvas

2. [HW - Sine Wave](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-sine-wave.md) - Here we are going to explore common periodic functions by building both a static sine wave, and an animated one, and maybe give you some ideas for Project 1. Be sure to follow along!

3. Phyllotaxis - [HW - Algorithmic Botany](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-algorithmic-botany.md)
