# Week 11A - Intro to Node.js
-->

<!--
## I. Overview
- **Node.js** is a command-line JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, **npm**, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
- Node.js runs on your local machine via the command line, or on a server, it does not run in the user's browser
- https://nodejs.org/en/
