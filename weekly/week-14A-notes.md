# Week 14A - Project 2 Work Day

## I. Topics
- Helpful Project 2 Sample Code (see myCourses):
  - the **"Yip" demo links** in myCourses will be very helpful in architecting your application
  - **counter-component-fun.html** demos:
    - that components can have their own `data` property that is independently owned by that component
    - how to pass arguments to components
    - how components can use `$emit` to call a method in the main interface
    - how to use `v-model` with a component
  - **pass-data-to-vue.html** shows how to pass data "into" Vue from the "outside" - a good use case would be if your map code needed to communicate with your Vue instance
- Here's an older demo on how to integrate Vue & Google Maps (but the "Yip" demo is probably more useful for Project 2) --> [demo-vue-plus-google-maps.md](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/demo-vue-plus-google-maps.md)
- Look at Project 2 prototypes
- Troubleshoot Project 2 issues


## II. Final Exam Review Resources
- For the final exam, you are allowed a "cheat sheet":
  - it will be a 3" x 5" index card
  - you can write on the front and back of the index card
  - it must be hand-written, and in your own handwriting (because the primary benefit of a cheat sheet is in the time that you spend studying and writing down the material, you often end up learning it and thus don't need the cheat sheet very much)
- The final exam review notes are here --> [Final Exam Review](../exams/final-exam-review.md)
