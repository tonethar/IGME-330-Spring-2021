# Week 4B - JavaScript ES6 Module Pattern

## I. Project 1

- [Project 1](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2021/blob/main/projects/project-1.md) has been assigned:
  - See discussion thread in myCourses where you will post your project idea and (optional) partner's name
  - See myCourses for deliverable due dates and descriptions
  - We will look at some project examples in class
  - Why might you want to put some effort into the project?
  - Want to talk about a project idea? Either hang around after class, or send us an email (or message through Slack)

## II. Review
- Let's look over [Canvas VI - Canvas Sprites](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-6.md) and see if there are any questions:
  - if there are, we'll take 20 minutes to work through as much as we can, ***together!***
  - and, we will make sure that today's lecture is recorded so that you can refer back to it if necessary

## III. ES6 Modules
- Are you sick of writing all of your JS code in one file and jamming everything into the global scope? ***You should be!***
- Today we are going to look at how to implement the *ES6 Module Pattern*:
  - [ES6 Module Pattern Notes](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/ES-6-module-pattern-2195.md)
  - See myCourses for the demo code
- Note: One of the requirements of Project 1 is to utilize the *ES6 Module Pattern*
- It is very likely we will run out of time today, but no worries! This lecture has been pre-recorded, and the links to these videos are on the bottom of the page linked above. You will need to watch BOTH videos before you can complete the "Refactor Sprity to ES6 Modules" HW assignment
