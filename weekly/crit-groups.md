# Critique Groups

An important aspect of any kind of project development is the iterative consideration of user feedback and testing.  In this course, we will give you opportunities to solicit, receive, and consider feedback from others about your project as well as contribute to the improvement of the projects of others by sharing your own observations and suggestions with them.

We will do this through the use of both an online asynchronous crit group (this coming weekend on Slack) and through an online progress presentation (in Zoom breakout rooms next week).

There will be 5 phases to this process:

### TL;DR:
  1. Post Prototype by Wednesday Night.  You may get some initial feedback Thursday.
  2. Look for Crit-Groups on Slack and post your work-in-progress by Saturday night.
  3. Give feedback to all others by Sunday night (see pinned post in group)
  4. Be prepared to demo your project via screen-share on Tuesday of next week.
  5. Keep using the Crit Groups.  They will be the same for Project 2.

## 1. Submit your Project prototype by Wednesday evening before your scheduled Thursday Zoom class meeting.

For this submission, you should have something "working" visually for your project.  Several controls should be present (although not with final styling).  Something interesting should be happening on your web page canvas (or canvases).  If the user will be able to interact with the experience through keyboard or mouse an initial attempt at this should be present so that it can be tested.  

Depending on your section, the Instructor will open and look at these submissions live during class on Thursday, providing first-reaction feedback and suggestions.  You may also be asked to provide further explanation about your plans, etc.  (So have your microphone ready!)

## 2. By Saturday, you will be required to post a URL to your work-in-progress to your Slack Crit-Group.

In Slack, you will find yourself added to a Crit Group which contains about 5 other students from this course (across all 4 sections).  You will continue to have and use this Crit Group throughout the rest of the semester (including for your 2nd Project).  You should get to know this group of students.  You will be allowed to freely share links to your progress so far in this group and ask for ongoing feedback as you continue to work on things through the rest of the semester.

You may also continue to improve and post updates to your project.  Both instructors and teaching assistants will be able to visit and (time permitting) provide feedback on your work as well.

## 3. By Sunday, you must provide a short but thoughtful feedback write-up to each of the other people in your Crit Group. 

Following the suggestions in a pinned post in your Crit Group, you should provide feedback about multiple aspects of the other projects posted to your group.  A sample posting will be included so you can get an idea of the kind of feedback we're expecting. Your participation in this regard is absolutely required and will be checked and applied to your course participation grade. 

Whether or not you follow the advice and/or implement all of the suggestions you get from this process is totally up to you, but we encourage you to take some of these suggestions to heart so as to bring your project closer to the impactful, portfolio-worthy project that we are recommending you create.  Feel free to open a two-way dialog with the people who've given you critiques asking for clarification and/or more details if necessary.  Keep improving your project and let others know when there's something new to try out!

## 4. On Tuesday, March 9th, during your class Zoom call, you'll be placed into breakout rooms for feedback demos.  

Each person in your group will have about 5 to 10 minutes to screen-share and demonstrate your project so far (hopefully with further updates).  You'll begin by opening your project explaining how it works and demonstrating it.  You may also share a live link to your project in the Chat window so that other students can try it out as well.  After your demonstration ask for further feedback and document what people say.  We will ask you to submit your notes after this call to a myCourses dropbox.

## 5. You can and should continue to participate in your Slack Crit Group as the final deadline draws closer.  

Since you'll remain in the same group for Project 2, you should foster community within your group.  Continuing to communicate with each other about this Project and other concerns, questions, ideas, etc as the semester goes on is welcome.  You'll receive a new "pinned post" when it's time to start considering Project 2.
