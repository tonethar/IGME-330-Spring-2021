# Week 12B - Intro to Vue.js

- Up until now, we've been using pretty just the standard [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/) library!
- Now it's time for data-binding via the Vue.js MVVM framework!

## III. Reference
- **Reactive Programming** - I like the definition from [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2501666) - "Reactive programming has recently gained popularity as a paradigm that is well-suited for developing event-driven and interactive applications. It facilitates the development of such applications by providing abstractions to express time-varying values and automatically managing dependencies between such values."
- **MVVM ("Model–view–viewmodel")** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-viewmodel - the ViewModel of MVVM is a value converter, meaning the view model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. ViewModel handles data binding, ensuring that the data changed in the Model immediately affects the View layer and vice versa. 
- **MVC v. MVVM** - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/667781/what-is-the-difference-between-mvc-and-mvvm
