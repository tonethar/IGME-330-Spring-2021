# Week 7B - Bitmap Manipulation
-->

<!--
- Look at (a few) [Project 2](../projects/project-2.md) protoypes

# Week 7B - JavaScript Prototype Chain

- Let's first talk about the "P" word (not "Project 1")
- Project 1:
  - you have had about 3 weeks to work on it 
  - thus we are hoping for a lot of portfolio quality projects (or nearly so)
  - more important than getting a "good grade" would be to have something that you can show to an employer
  - **some of the project prototypes still look very similar to the HW starting code (Phyllotaxis, Walkers, Sprity, etc...)**
