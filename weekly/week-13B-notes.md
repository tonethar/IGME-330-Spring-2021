# Week 13B - JavaScript Topics

- Recharge Day #3!

<!--
- We are at the end of the course content! There are just 2 more JavaScript "quirks" that we need to review with you, and they are both discussed below!

## I. Topics
- Two unusual JavaScript features:
  - [JavaScript Closures](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/closure-notes.md)
  - [`this` binding](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/this-binding-notes.md) and event handlers/event listeners
- In the future, if you ever have an interview for a web or JS position, come back and review these notes!
