# Week 13B - JavaScript Topics

- We are at the end of the course content! There are just 2 more JavaScript "quirks" that we need to review with you, and they are both discussed below!

## I. Topics
- Two unusual JavaScript features:
  - [JavaScript Closures](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/closure-notes.md)
  - [`this` binding](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/this-binding-notes.md) and event handlers/event listeners
- In the future, if you ever have an interview for a web or JS position, come back and review these notes!
  
## II. Final Exam Review Resources
- For the final exam, you are allowed a "cheat sheet":
  - it will be a 3" x 5" index card
  - you can write on the front and back of the index card
  - it must be hand-written, and in your own handwriting (because the primary benefit of a cheat sheet is in the time that you spend studying and writing down the material, you often end up learning it and thus don't need the cheat sheet very much)
- The final exam review notes are here --> [Final Exam Review](../exams/final-exam-review.md)
